    "ID": "CMPE-160",
    "DESC": "This course covers the specification, analysis, modeling and design of digital systems. Standard modules, such as decoders, multiplexers, shifter registers, adders, and counters, will be analyzed. Lectures will discuss fundamental design methodologies, state machines, and digital system modeling with the use of VHDL as a hardware description language. The laboratory provides hands-on experiences of the design, modeling, implementation, and testing of digital systems using commercial IC components as well as CAD tools. Co-requisite: CSCI-105 or CSCI-140 or CSCI-141 or equivalent course.  "

    "DESC": "This course presents modern approaches to the design, modeling and testing of digital system. Topics covered are: VHDL and Verilog HDL as hardware description languages (HDLs), simulation techniques, design synthesis, verification methods, and implementation with field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Combinational and both the synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits are studied. Testing and design for testability techniques are emphasized and fault tolerant and fail safe design concepts are introduced. Laboratory projects that enable students gain hands-on experience are required. The projects include complete design flow: design of the system, modeling using HDLs, simulation, synthesis and verification. Prerequisites: CMPE-160 or CMPE-161 or equivalent courses. Co-requisites: PHYS-212 or PHYS-208 or EEEE-281 or equivalent courses.  "
